# ðŸŒ¹ A Nice Story by GitHub Users (2023)

So, here's my idea. It started [back in 2020](https://github.com/mistermantas/githubers-write-stories/blob/main/README-2020.md).

While signing up for Hacktoberfest, I thought "this is about writing code together." What else can we do together?

Write words. Create a little world by storytelling inside this one file.

## Contributing Rules

* **One PR per person** (do not cheat for Hacktoberfest â€” make some other quality PRs!)
* Important: **always write at the end of the document**. Leave some space for others, so we get some separation.
* Write **at least 100 (really good) words, but no more than 500**.
* Please do not leave any unintentional spelling, grammar, punctuation mistakes. Keep it classy.
* Limit profanity, no hate speech, etc. Good intentions only.

(Also, star the repository, if you like the idea and want more people to see it!)

## The 2023 Story
