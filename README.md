# ðŸŒ¹ A Nice Story by GitHub Users

So, here's my idea.

While signing up for Hacktoberfest this year, I thought "this is about writing code together." What else can we do together?

Write words. Create little worlds inside this one file.

*Everything here goes into the public domain (CC0 license).*

## Contributing

* **One PR per person** (do not cheat for Hacktoberfest â€” make some other more quality PRs!)
* Important: **always write at the end of the document**. Leave some space for others, so we get some separation 
* Write **at least 50 (really good) words, but no more than 250**. If you haven't guessed yet â€” write in English!
* Limit profanity, no hate speech, etc. Good intentions only. **Let's have some good fun!** No pressure

(Also, star the repository, if you like the idea and want more people to see it!)

I'll start with the intro paragraph which is 68 words and is going to be pretty vague, but that's on purpose. Take initiave or follow along with what others have written before you!

I wanted to try something different today. I wanted to write. Writing is the tool that helps people to think. Itâ€™s also something that transcends reality in a way, no? Well, because when you write you can create your own universe â€” of knowledge, of chaos, or emotion. In this story, they're called paragraphs. But less about my technique, dear reader, there's something I've been meaning to tell you...

Itâ€™s been a busy September. I had a lot to get done and Iâ€™m still working on finishing some things I started in September. No matter how busy I am, I continue to find time to read â€” I never want to stop learning. Iâ€™m determined to continue this reading habit to support my decision to keep learning new things. It opens my mind! The Purpose Of Life Is Not Happiness: Itâ€™s Usefulness. Being useful is a mindset. And like with any mindset, it starts with a decision.

My decision now is to move, it is time. With all of the craziness going on in the world I have realized that there is no time like the present. My decision to move was not sudden, although it still feels that way. Before the pandemic, I felt stuck and wanted to get away, but I kept thinking about all of the reasons not to. You know the usual - bills, insurance, job-search, finding a place to live, being away from family, etc..But after the accident, I knew it was time to go, I now understand that life is to short to live in fear.

I got up from my bed, which was wet from the leak, and put on my boots. I walked into the kitchen, gave my dog his food and topped up with water and gave him a pat on the head. I knew they were coming. I walked outside and I saw him, standing in the rain, staring at me with the type of gaze you only see on TV shoes in his black coat with his black briefcase and black umbrella. He closed his umbrella and just stood there. Getting wet, like ***the*** mango...
