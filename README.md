# ðŸŒ¹ A Nice Story by GitHub Users

So, here's my idea.

While signing up for Hacktoberfest this year, I thought "this is about writing code together." What else can we do together?

Write words. Create little worlds inside this one file.

## Contributing

* **One PR per person** (do not cheat for Hacktoberfest â€” make some other more quality PRs!)
* Important: **always write at the end of the document**. Leave some space for others, so we get some separation 
* Write **at least 50 (really good) words, but no more than 250**. If you haven't guessed yet â€” write in English!
* Limit profanity, no hate speech, etc. Good intentions only. **Let's have some good fun!** No pressure

I'll start with the intro paragraph which is 68 words and is going to be pretty vague, but that's on purpose. Take initiave or follow along with what others have written before you!

I wanted to try something different today. I wanted to write. Writing is the tool that helps people to think. Itâ€™s also something that transcends reality in a way, no? Well, because when you write you can create your own universe â€” of knowledge, of chaos, or emotion. In this story, they're called paragraphs. But less about my technique, dear reader, there's something I've been meaning to tell you...



Itâ€™s been a busy September.I had a lot to get done and Iâ€™m still working on finishing some things I started in September.No matter how busy I am, I continue to find time to read â€” I never want to stop learning. Iâ€™m determined to continue this reading habit to support my decision to keep learning new things.It opens my mind!.The Purpose Of Life Is Not Happiness: Itâ€™s Usefulness.Being useful is a mindset. And like with any mindset, it starts with a decision.
